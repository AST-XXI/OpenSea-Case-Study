For interactions to work properly in the blockchain the Ethereum blockchain has various technical standards for different types of tokens on its network

ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-721 tokens are all unique, making these tokens rare or one-of-a-kind collectables. In contrast, ERC-1155 utilizes what is known as the Multi Token Standard, which allows for each token identification to represent a new configurable token type, giving it is own set of supply and other attributes

NBA Top Shot, which offers video highlights of players in forms of NFTs, had over $200M sales volume for the months of February and March.
[Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/) is the company behind the success of [NBA Top Shots](https://nbatopshot.com/) with over 3M+ transactions and over $500M in sales. Additionally, Dapper has partnered with the UFC to bring UFC digital collectibles.
According to NBC sports, NFL is the highest-grossing sports league in the world, with an estimated $16 billion in pre-pandemic revenue in 2019 versus $8.76 billion for the NBA for the 2018-19 season. Partnering with the NFL to bring digital sports cards will help OverSea grow a larger user base.
